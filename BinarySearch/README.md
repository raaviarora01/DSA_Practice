## üß† Binary Search Overview

Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm for **sorted** arrays or collections. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, achieving logarithmic time complexity.

## üìä Complexity Analysis

| Approach                | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Iterative Binary Search | O(1)                   | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                | O(1)             |
| Recursive Binary Search | O(1)                   | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                | O(log n) (stack) |
| Optimized Search        | O(1)                   | O(log n)                  | O(log n)                | O(1)             |
