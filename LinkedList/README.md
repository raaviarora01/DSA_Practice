| Operation                     | Singly LL | Doubly LL | Circular Singly LL | Circular Doubly LL |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Insertion at head             | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(1)               | O(1)               |
| Insertion at tail (no tail)   | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)               | O(n)               |
| Insertion at tail (with tail) | O(1)      | O(1)      | O(1)               | O(1)               |
| Insertion at position         | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)               | O(n)               |

| Deletion at tail (no tail)    | O(n)      | O(1)      | O(n)               | O(1)               |
| Deletion at tail (with tail)  | O(n)      | O(1)      | O(n)               | O(1)               |
| Deletion at position          | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)               | O(n)               |

## üíæ Space Complexity Analysis

| Linked List Type     | Space Complexity            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Singly Linked List   | O(n)                        |
| Doubly Linked List   | O(n) + O(n) `prev` pointers |
| Circular Singly List | O(n)                        |
| Circular Doubly List | O(n) + O(n) `prev` pointers |

> üí° Tail pointer is an optimization for improving time complexity at the end operations.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Doubly lists require extra memory for backward traversal (`prev` pointer).
